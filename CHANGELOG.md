## [3.1.0] - 2020-10-08

### Added
- Module now fully supports the use of `cert_file` parameter, which accepts the path to the PEM-encoded
  x509 CA certificate chain for Conjur. Users can supply the module with certificate path in `cert_file` OR
  with certificate contents in `ssl_certificate`.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#105](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/105)

### Changed
- Conjur server errors now have better descriptions.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#241](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/241)
- If `authn_api_key` is not wrapped in `Sensitive` class, we now raise a descriptive
  error as to why we cannot proceed.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#232](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/232)
- Warnings are now logged whenever this module attempts to use a non-HTTPS endpoint.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#144](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/144)

## [3.0.0] - 2020-09-17

### Added
- Secrets are now retrieved by the Puppet agent, instead of the server, using Puppet's
  [deferred function feature](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.17/deferring_functions.html).
  This aligns with Puppet's documented best practices.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#13](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/13)
- Module now follows Puppet development best practices and uses
  [PDK](https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/1.x/pdk.html) for linting, unit tests, and publishing.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#64](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/64)

### Changed
- `conjur::secret` now must be used as a `Deferred` function. Method signature has
  changed as well, including providing of optional parameters as a Hash.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#13](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/13)
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#184](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/184)
- When Conjur configuration cannot be resolved on the agent, we now log a warning
  that this is potentially a result of misconfiguration.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#125](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/125)
- This module now logs a warning if no certificates are parsed from the provided certificate
  string.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#115](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/115)

### Fixed
- Account names with special characters that require encoding (eg. `+`, ` `, etc) are
  now properly escaped when variables are fetched from Conjur / DAP within the
  `conjur::secret` function.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#170](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/170)

### Removed
- Support for using the Conjur Puppet module with Conjur Enterprise v4.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#66](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/66)
- Support for using this module with Puppet v5.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#104](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/104)
- Support for using host factory tokens, `conjur` class, `cert_file` parameter, and using
  server-side `conjur` class to pre-populate on-agent info.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#104](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/104)

## [2.0.6] - 2020-08-10

### Deprecated
- Support for using the Conjur Puppet module with Puppet v5 is now deprecated.
  Support will be removed in the next major release.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#180](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/180)
- Support for configuring this module to exchange
  [host factory](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Operations/Services/host_factory.html)
  tokens for Conjur host identities and API keys is now deprecated. You may still configure your
  systems to [create a host](https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Developer/Conjur_API_Create_Host.htm)
  using host factory, however, as long as you provide this module with the Conjur host identity
  and API key.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#180](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/180)

## [2.0.5] - 2020-07-28

  and 20.04, Debian 9 and 10, and Alpine 3.9.

### Deprecated
- Support for using the Conjur Puppet module with Conjur Enterprise v4 is now
  deprecated. Support will be removed in the next major release. The `conjurize`
  method of providing the Conjur Puppet module with its Conjur identity will
  also no longer be supported as of the next version.
- Support for using the Conjur Puppet module with [Windows Server 2008](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search?alpha=Windows%20Server%202008)

  Registry on Windows as an alternative to using the existing `ssl_certificate`
  parameter.

  Puppet CA chains.
  [cyberark/conjur-puppet#44](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-puppet/issues/44)

  running with HFT-created identities, and is updated with improved logging
  for Windows-based configuration and credential fetching.
